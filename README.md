# Free-Cl-detection-Sensor
We are developing a portable, paper-based sensor using a  graphene and PEDOT:PSS nanohybrid material to detect  residual chlorine in water, enhanced with AI capabilities.
Our sensor detects chlorine levels as low as 0.1 ppm,
exceeding BIS 10500:2012 matches WHO standards.
It contains all the important steps that I have taken to develop it, this also contains code etc.
